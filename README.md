## Install

Install the package.

``` r
devtools::install_github("JohnCoene/mjml")
```

Install [MJML](https://mjml.io/).

```bash
# Install with npm in a folder where you will use MJML
$> npm install mjml

# In the folder where you installed MJML you can now run:
$> ./node_modules/.bin/mjml -V

# To avoid typing ./node_modules/.bin/, add it to your PATH (add it to .bashrc or .zshrc so you don't have to export it anymore):
$> export PATH="$PATH:./node_modules/.bin"

# You can now run MJML directly, in that folder:
$> mjml -V
```
